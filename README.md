**NOTE: Since version 0.7.0 the configuration keys for lock and unlock actions are no longer supported, for now. Use 'usesDoorLatch' for doors with door latch.**

**NOTE: Since version 0.4.0 the configuration changed to platform. You must fix your configuration to match the new configuration format.**

# homebridge-nukiio
Nuki.io support for Homebridge: https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge

# Current state
Seems to work solid. Feel free to create new issues in github for any problems.

# Requirements
You need the following information from your bridge for the configuration:
- You must activate the developer mode on you bridge
- The URL to your bridge, IP and port can be configured when setting up the bridge in the Nuki App, example http://10.0.0.1:8080
- The API token, can be configured when setting up the bridge in the Nuki App
- The nuki id of your locks, can be found when calling http://your-nuki-bridge-url/list?token=your-nuki-api-token in a browser

# Configuration
Example config.json:

    {
        "platforms": [
            {
                "platform": "NukiBridge",
                "bridge_url": "your-nuki-bridge-url",
                "api_token" : "your-nuki-api-token",
                "request_timeout_lockstate": 5000, // (in ms, optional, default: 5000)
                "request_timeout_lockaction": 30000, // (in ms, optional, default: 30000)
                "cache_directory": "./.node-persist/storage", // (optional, default: "./.node-persist/storage")
                "webhook_server_ip_or_name": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", // (optional, must be the IP/Hostname of the server running homebridge)
                "webhook_port": 51827, // (optional, default: 51827, must be a free port on the server running homebridge, NOT the same as homebridge)
                "lock_state_mode": 0, // (see below, optional, default: 0)
                "add_maintainance_buttons": false, // (optional, default: false, if set to true, than three switches will be added as accessory to do reboot, firmware update, and to refresh all locks state)
                "locks": [
                    {
                        "id": "your-lock-nukiid",
                        "name": "Front Door",
                        "usesDoorLatch" : true, // (default: false)
                        "priority" : 1, // (optional, default: 99 [locks with higher priority {lower number} will be proccessed first])
                        "polling": true, // (optional, default: false)
                        "pollingIntervall": 60  (optional, default: 60 [seconds for polling, if polling true])
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

## Configure lock state mode
You can choose one of the following values to determine how to retrieve the state of the locks:

|Value| Description|
|-|-|
|0 (default)| Lock states are requested from the bridge via /lockState. This means, that the bridge always connects to each lock via Bluetooth to retrieve an always up-to-date lock state. This mode takes a lot of time for retrieving the lock state when using more than one lock, as this can not be processed in parallel|
|1| Only use internal cached values by the plugin. These values get their state by using the webhooks of the bridge, so you need to active them. This mode is the fastest as no request are send to the bridge but of course has the drawback that the cache might not always be correct.|
|2| Lock states are requested from the bridge via /list using a last known lock state cached by Nuki bridge. This means, that the bridge does not connect to any lock via Bluetooth to retrieve lock state. This mode is faster than mode "0" but still makes requests to the bridge. If multiple locks request the lockstate in parallel than only one request is sent to bridge for all locks. The drawback is, that the last known state might not always be correct.|

## Use Nuki Webhook
Usually the plugin makes calls to Nuki bridge to get the state of a lock. Since Nuki supports Webhooks it is possible for Nuki to push a lock state on the fly to the plugin.
If the configuration parameter "webhook_server_ip_or_name" is set, than the plugin registers a Webhook in Nuki automatically if not already set to use it for lock state update and cache.

*Note: An automatically added Webhook does not get removed ever, so you need to do it manually if you don't need it anymore.*

## Doors with door latches
You can define if a door uses a door latch by setting 'usesDoorLatch' to true. If you do so, than three locks will be added to homekit. One that unlocks the door pulling the door latch ("lockname Unlatch"), one that unlocks the door without
pulling the door latch ("lockname"), and one that always is display as locked and pulls the door latch on unlock ("lockname ALWAYS Unlatch").

# Additional information
The plugin uses the Nuki API of the bridge. The API token can be configured via the Nuki app when enabling the API.
The plugin was build on Nuki API documentation v1.0.3. Valid values for lock action and unlock action can be found in the Nuki API documentation.
